# Python-port-scanner
<br> I have created a port scanner for python which is very easy to use
I got the idea from the nmap and built my own port scanner. It will help us to find out the vulnerability present in systems.      
<br>So letâ€™s see how to use it.  
<br>
<br><h3>So before that for the banner you need to install the pyfiglet module</h3>
			 pip install pyfiglet

<br>
<h3> After running the portscan.py for the first time</h3>

<br>
<br>
So you can scan any target using this port scanner.
